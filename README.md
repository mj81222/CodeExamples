# CodeExamples

This repository houses code I've previously written for various projects during my master's program. 

My coding skills have improved significantly since writing this code, however, these tasks demonstrate my deep understanding of genomics concepts and statistics principles. Although I would love to share code written during my internship at Genentech or for my thesis project, I cannot currently do so as they're on legal hold and embargoed, respectively.
